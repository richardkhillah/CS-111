Limitations: Python3 is required to run this program. Makefile creates a symlink


Files:
Makefile: builds the lab deliverables: executables, distribution tarball, and required output.

lab3b.py: required source code implementing P3B.html specs.

lab3b: 	executable that analyze a file system summary (a .csv file generated from lab3a)
		and reports on all found inconsistencies. It generates
		    Block Consistency Audits
		    I-node Allocation Audits
		    Directory Consistency Audits
		and reports findings to stdout.

P3B_check.sh: the (provided) check script. Once the distribution tarball has been
				made, run `$ make check` to perform the sanity check.
