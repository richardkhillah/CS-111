NAME: Anirudh Veeraragavan

Project 0 - Warmup

Included Files
lab0.c
- This is the C source code for the lab0 executable. It compiles cleanly with
gcc and supports the options --input=filename, --output=filename, --segfault,
and --catch.
Makefile
- This is the make file used to produce the lab0 executable among other things.
make will produce the lab0 executable; make check will run a quick smoke-test on
the executable; make clean will delete all files created by the Makefile
including the executable; make dist will build the distribution tarball.
backtrace.png
- This is a screenshot of the gdb output when viewing the backtrace of the
segmentation fault caused by the --segfault argument.
breakpoint.png
- This is a screenshot of the gdb output with a breakpoint at the bad assignment
allowing us to confirm that the pointer is indeed NULL.

Smoke-test Cases
1) Check whether the program can copy STDIN to STDOUT
2) Check whether the program can copy --input=filename to STDOUT
3) Check whether the program can copy STDIN to --output=filename
4) Check whether the program can copy --input=filename to --output=filename
5) Check whether the program causes a segfault with --segfault
6) Check whether the program catches a segfault with --segfault --catch
7) Check whether the program reports an invalid --input=filename
8) Check whether the program catches a segfault with all options selected

Limitations
1) The option parsing is not completely robust and certain invalid options used in specific ways
can cause the executable to crash or exhibit strange behavior.

2) The smoke-test run by the Makefile is not completely thorough and only covers core functionality.
