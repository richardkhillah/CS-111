Limitations:

THIS BUILD IS INTENEDED TO BE RUN ON A BEAGLEBONE.

This project has been tested on lnxsrv07 and lnxsrv09 as well as on my beaglebone.
Everything works fine. I have had issues getting `uname -r | grep beaglebone - `
to work.

If you are testing on a beaglebone, uncomment lines 31, 33, 34, 35... That should do the trick

Files:
Makefile: builds the lab deliverables: executables, distribution tarball, and required output.

utils.h/c: the header and source files for commonly used utilies

lab4b.c: the required source file for the lab

lab4b: the required executable, built to be tested with the .sh script

my_check.sh: a quick smoke test to ensure lab4b takes all required arguments and 
logs to a logfile.

P4B_check.sh: the check script provided as a sanity check measure.
