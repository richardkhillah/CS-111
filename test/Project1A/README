Included Files:
	1. lab1a.c - Contains the source code for setting up a character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal I/O,
				 forking/creating a shell child process, passing input and output between two processes, 
				 shutdown processing, and error checking for all system calls.
	2. Makefile - make (default) compiles the source code into an executable called lab1a, 
				  make clean removes all files created by the Makefile, 
				  and make dist zips up the necessary files into a tar.gz.
	3. README - This file containing the project description.

For this project, I heavily referenced the Linux manual on man7.org for the various functions/commands that 
were specified in the spec. I also used gnu.org to better understand its utilities, especially how to do 
noncanonical input (URL given below):
