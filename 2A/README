	contains two for loops. One to generate non-sync options, and the
	other to generate sync options. The output of the kernal of each loop
	will be appended to corresponding .csv files, e.g., lab2_add.csv or lab2_list.csv.
	The script is also used to generate test cases for Makefile.
	This funcationality simply echos and appends commands to auxillary
	Makefiles, i.e., lab2_add test cases are concatenated to makel2add.mk.
	the top level Makefile -include(s) auxiliery makefiles, and when
	'$ make tests' is executed, Makefile corresponding runs the
	'add_tests' and 'list_tests' recipes in l2add_tests.mk and l2list_tests.mk respectively.



QUESTION 2.1.1 - causing conflicts:
	Why does it take many iterations before errors are seen?
	Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?
