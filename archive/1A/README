Makefile creates the distribution tarball, makes the executable lab1a, and cleans
the any files produced by make.

lab1a.c is a terminal/shell program that puts the keyboard into non-canonical with no echo
mode. With no option provided, lab1a simply echos input received via the keyboard to the
screen. Supplying lab1a with --shell options, all stdin received via the keyboard is
both echoed to stdout and forwarded to a forked subprocess. The subprocess shuts down
as a result of having recieved ^D or ^C from the keyboard.

limitations:
lab1a only prints output generated from the shell once ^D is received from the keyboard.
if ^C is received, any output generated by the shell get's discarded.
