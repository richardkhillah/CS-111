Makefile creates the distribution tarball, makes the executable lab1a, and cleans
the any files produced by make.

lab1a.c is a terminal/shell program that puts the keyboard into non-canonical with no echo
mode. With no option provided, lab1a simply echos input received via the keyboard to the
screen. Supplying lab1a with --shell options, all stdin received via the keyboard is
both echoed to stdout and forwarded to a forked subprocess. The subprocess shuts down
as a result of having recieved ^D or ^C from the keyboard.

lab1a supports --debug option enables several flags throughout the program.
debugging statements within the code base will have the form:
if(d_flag) debug(msg);

where d_flag is a global scoped variable indicating whether the --debug option has
been passed to lab1a, debug is a function the prints the message msg to stderr.

limitations:
lab1a only prints output generated from the shell once ^D is received from the keyboard.
if ^C is received, any output generated by the shell get's discarded.

According to sanity check, lab1a fails 6 sanity checks. The 6 failed sanity checks
are below:
... confirming correct large-burst input processing
... FAIL echo $SHELL
STDERR DUMP FOLLOWS
EXPECTATION NOT FULFILLED
STDOUT DUMP FOLLOWS
... confirming cr->nl mapping on shell input
... FAIL
... confirming shell exit status reporting
FAIL ... expected STATUS=9
... confirming interrupt generation to shell
FAIL ... shell did nnot report receiving SIGINT
... confirming EOF generation to shell
FAIL ... expected exit w/STATUS=0
STDOUT dump follows
... checking for orphaned processes
